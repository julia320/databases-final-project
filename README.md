# CS 2541 Final Project: University Application, Registration, and Advising System
The code in the `application_system` folder is from Phase 1 where I worked solely on the application system
part of the project, while the code in the `fully_integrated_system` folder is from Phase 2 where I merged
that system with two other groups who had done the registration and advising systems, respectively.
